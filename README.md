## Description
This case study is done on the dataset that contains the data about the applications in Google Play Store. The primary purpose of this analysis is to do the analysis on the application dataset and find out insights related to the factors that affect the ratings of the applications.
Here, the data analysis is performed by handling Missing Values, then handling Incorrect datatypes and then doing Sanity checks to ensure correct and logical data for analysis and afterwards handling outliers and finally performing analysis on the cleaned data through visualisation and finding crucial insights that affect the ratings of the applications.
* Missing Values are handled by assigning estimated values to the missing value columns with respect to their datatype (Object, int/float).
* Incorrect datatypes are handled by removing the non-essential text from the values in order to convert the datatype best suited for analysis and then finally converting the datatype.
* Sanity checks are done by checking the each column and their values and comapring it with other columns to keep the data logical
* Outliers are handled by visualising the data using Boxplots and removing extreme value/outliers from the dataset that affect the analysis.\
* Then, finally the data analysis is done through visualising the data and finding out the effect of other variables on the target variable ("Rating").
